Metadata:

- Survival months:
	- Survival time in months
	- Missing values are encoded as "Unknown"

- Vital status recode (study cutoff used):
	- Indicator value taking values in {"Alive", "Dead"}

- COD to site recode:
	- COD abbreviated "Cause of Death"
	- Categorical variable indicating the cause of death of each subject
	- "Pancreas" indicates death caused by pancreatic cancer.
	- "Alive" indicates that the patient is still alive.

- CS tumor size (2004-2015):
	- CS abbreviates "Collaborative stage"
	- Was only collected from 2004 onwards.
	- Code	Description
	  000		No mass/tumor found
	  001-988	001 - 988 millimeters (mm)
			(Exact size in mm)
	  989		989 mm or larger
	  990		Microscopic focus or foci only and no size of focus given
	  991		Described as "less than 1 centimeter (cm)"
	  992		Described as "less than 2 cm," or "greater than 1 cm," or "between 1 cm and 2 cm"
	  		Stated as T1 with no other information on  size

- Summary stage 2000 (1998+):
	- Simplified version of cancer stage
	- Value		Description
	  "In situ"		Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue.
	  "Localized"	Cancer is limited to the place where it started, with no sign that it has spread.
	  "Regional"	Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, tissues, or organs.
	  "Distant"		Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.
	  "Unknown"		There is not enough information to figure out the stage.

- Sex:
	- Variable taking values in {"Male", "Female"}

- Age at diagnosis:
	- Age of the subject at diagnosis.

- Race recode (White, Black, Other):
	- Variable indicating the race of the subject
